# fake86_to_stm32f429_port
8086 PC emulator for STM32F429 MCU

Some more info: https://hackaday.io/project/153287-fake86-emulator-for-stm32  

The biggest problem of this project is that CPU emulation speed is very low - less than 1 MHz.


This project is based on Core429I dev board.


I make a custom dev board with R-2R DAC for creating VGA image, holder for microSD card and USB A connector.
